## Quick Reference

### Project Structure
```
.github/               # CI/CD
backend/               # Cloud Functions (Node 20) and Firestore rules
frontend/              # Angular 20 standalone app (Material, AngularFire)
memory/                # Product docs/notes (non-code, for context)
scripts/               # Dev scripts (lint, typecheck, emulators, build)
firebase.json          # Firebase configuration (hosting, functions, rules, emulators)
.firebaserc            # Firebase project aliases
```

### Key Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode in both frontend and backend
- No `any` for domain models; use interfaces in `frontend/src/app/types/`
- Small, composable files
- Relative imports within each package
- Shared constants in `paths.ts` files

See individual rule files for detailed specifications.
